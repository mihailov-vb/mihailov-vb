Hello!
My name is Vladimir. I am 31 years old and I really want to move into the IT field.
I work for a construction company. Office.

I am currently learning the Java programming language. I'm taking a course JavaRush + Stepik + self-education.

I am at the very beginning of my journey in the IT field, although I cannot say the same about my life path.
